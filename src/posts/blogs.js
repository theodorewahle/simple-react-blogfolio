      "I don't think the shortage of computer science educators in the US will get better until the economics get a lot better for teachers.",
      "My little brother's high school CS class is all online. The teacher doesn't know the material.",
      `I think asking kids to "self-teach" CS in the classroom is OK, but my understanding is that it's hard to be TAUGHT math during one period and then be teaching themselves CS in the next.`,
      `Yes, CS can be self-learned, but the biggest problem with the lack of CS educators IMO is that CS students don't have mentors/role-models who can encourage them to stay with CS.`,
      `I purposely used the term "self-learned" instead of "self-taught." "Self-taught' is a misnomer. It's used to describe anyone who didn't take CS classes in high school or college. BUT most self-taughtcoders took online courses or watched a tutorial series with teachers who are often way more engaging than the in-person professionals.`,
      `Besides, there's a false dichotomy between self-taught or teacher-taught because CS classroom curricula comprise a fraction of the knowledge one needs to complete a project. To that end, all programmers I've met are mostly "self-learned."`]
