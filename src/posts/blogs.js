      "I don't think the shortage of computer science educators in the US will get better until the economics get a lot better for teachers.",
      "My little brother's high school CS class is all online. The teacher doesn't know the material.",
      `I think asking kids to "self-teach" CS in the classroom is OK, but my understanding is that it's hard to be TAUGHT math during one period and then be teaching themselves CS in the next.`,
      `Yes, CS can be self-learned, but the biggest problem with the lack of CS educators IMO is that CS students don't have mentors/role-models who can encourage them to stay with CS.`,
      `I purposely used the term "self-learned" instead of "self-taught." "Self-taught' is a misnomer. It's used to describe anyone who didn't take CS classes in high school or college. BUT most self-taughtcoders took online courses or watched a tutorial series with teachers who are often way more engaging than the in-person professionals.`,
      `Besides, there's a false dichotomy between self-taught or teacher-taught because CS classroom curricula comprise a fraction of the knowledge one needs to complete a project. To that end, all programmers I've met are mostly "self-learned."`]

  "title" : "knowledge debt in machine learning",
  "subtitle" : "2 september 2018",

    "I've realized that – at least in computer science – 'knowledge debt' is just as evil as technical debt. You incur knowledge debt when you choose not to learn a concept that you come across while programming.",
    "For example, let's say you are learning Machine Learning through an online course, and you come across the concept of Linear Regression. You have two choices. You can:",
    "a) stop the course and take time to understand the concepts WITHIN linear regression (e.g. Least Squares Fitting)",
    "or",
    "b) you can understand the bare minimum to use a linear regression function (i.e. this line is the best fit for these points)",
    "Either choice is reasonable. The reality is, you may not NEED to understand linear regression to get your script working. By choosing to bypass understanding this concept, you're taking out a loan in the currency of time.",
    `We have such advanced ML packages that so much of the fundamental mathematics of ML have been abstracted out for casual programmers. Knowledge debt can be useful. Like real debt, it's a tool. It's good for momentum.`,
    `But I fear there will come a time when I will introduce bugs into my code because I am completely missing the fundamentals of some of these ML functions I'm working with.`,
    "As my learning advances, the topics I encounter will be increasingly complex. As a result, each new concept will take longer to learn than the last. If I choose not to acquire a fundamental understanding of these advanced concepts, I am taking out a big, risky loan and adding it to my knowledge debt.",
    `I think a good rule of thumb is: if you have time to learn something more thoroughly, do it.`]
